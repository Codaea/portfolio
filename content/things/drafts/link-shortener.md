# NOT THAT INTRESTING OF A STORY TO TELL, WILL TELL SOME OTHER TIME
Every now and then, I yearn for the ability to overengineer something. As I tell a friend, "you have solutions looking for problems"

I don't exactly have that problem, but I do struggle to 

The game was really, "how many diffren't technologys can i use in shortening one link?"
